This is because if there were a shorter path, BFS would have discovered it at an earlier level of the search tree, and thus visited the target node sooner.\n",

However, a more typical analysis for standard BFS (where you reconstruct the path by parent pointers) would be O(V) for parent pointers and O(V) for the queue/visited set. In our implementation, where we store the full path with each queue item, the space complexity *could* be higher for dense graphs, but for typical use cases, it's still often discussed as O(V+E) if the paths are not excessively long or numerous in the queue at once.\n",

        "3.  **Incorrect Shortest Path:** While BFS intrinsically explores level by level, without a visited set, it might process a longer path to a node before a shorter one if the shorter path comes from an unvisited branch that happens to be encountered later in the queue. More importantly, it wouldn't guarantee finding *any* path in cyclic graphs, let alone the shortest.\n",

The queue could grow to hold an extremely large number of path states.\n",
