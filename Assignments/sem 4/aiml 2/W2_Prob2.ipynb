        "5.  **Avoid Cycles:** For each `neighbor`, check if it's already in the `path`. This prevents infinite loops in graphs with cycles.\n",
        "6.  **Recursive Call:** If a `neighbor` has not been visited in the current path, make a recursive call to `dfs` with the `neighbor` as the new `current_node`. Pass a copy of the current `path` to the recursive call to maintain separate paths for different branches.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Fundamental Characteristic: Deep Exploration:**\n",
        "    Depth-First Search (DFS) inherently explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. In the context of our library, this means DFS will pick a corridor and follow it to its end, or until it hits a dead-end or a previously visited node, before trying another path. This is akin to a person exploring one section of the library thoroughly before moving to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Suitability for Finding *Any* Path to a Deep Goal:**\n",
        "    This deep exploration makes DFS particularly suitable for problems where we need to find *any* path to a goal, especially if the goal might be located deep within the graph. DFS quickly dives into one part of the graph. If the 'Scroll' (our goal 'S') happens to be at the end of an early, deep path, DFS will find it efficiently without having to exhaustively explore all shallow nodes first. For instance, in our library, if the scroll is many rooms away but along a direct path from the start, DFS would likely find it faster than BFS, which would expand layer by layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Not Guaranteeing the Shortest Path:**\n",
        "    A significant characteristic of DFS is that it **does not guarantee finding the shortest path**. Because it explores deeply first, it might find a very long path to the goal if that path is encountered early in its search order, even if a much shorter path exists elsewhere. For our problem of finding a 'Scroll' in a library, this is generally an acceptable trade-off. Our primary objective is to *locate* the 'Scroll', not necessarily to find the absolute shortest route to it. As long as we find a way to the 'Scroll', the mission is accomplished. If finding the shortest path were critical (e.g., in an evacuation scenario), then an algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) would be more appropriate. For a simple discovery task, DFS's ability to quickly find *a* path is sufficient."

        "\n",
        "In graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), a 'visited' set (or similar mechanism) plays a critical role in ensuring the algorithm terminates and correctly explores the graph. It helps prevent infinite loops and redundant computations, especially in graphs containing cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **What is a 'visited' set?**\n",
        "    A 'visited' set is a data structure (commonly a set, list, or boolean array) used to keep track of nodes that have already been explored or are currently in the process of being explored during a graph traversal. When the algorithm encounters a node, it first checks if that node is already in the 'visited' set. If it is, the algorithm skips that node to avoid reprocessing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Why is a 'visited' set essential for DFS, especially with cycles?**\n",
        "    Graphs can contain cycles, which are paths that lead back to a previously visited node. In our library example, an \"illusion corridor\" could be a connection that takes you from Room X back to Room Y, where Room Y was previously visited on the same path. Without a mechanism to detect already visited nodes, DFS would continuously traverse these cycles, leading to an infinite loop. The 'visited' set acts as a memory, telling the algorithm, \"I've been here before, don't go down this path again in the current search branch.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Consequence of not using a 'visited' set in such graphs:**\n",
        "    If a 'visited' set is not used in a graph with cycles, the DFS algorithm will fall into an infinite loop. It would keep traversing the cycle indefinitely, never reaching the goal node (if it's outside the cycle) and never terminating. This would result in a stack overflow error in a recursive implementation due to excessive function calls, or an out-of-memory error in an iterative implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Reference to `dfs` and `dfs_with_logging`:**\n",
        "    In our implemented `dfs` and `dfs_with_logging` functions, the check `if neighbor not in path:` serves this purpose for the *current search branch*. The `path` list, which is passed recursively, ensures that a node is not revisited if it is already part of the current path leading to the `current_node`. This effectively prevents cycles *within that specific branch* from causing infinite loops.\n",

        "    While the `path` variable implicitly handles the visited state for the current branch, a more general approach, especially for completeness checks or algorithms that need to ensure every reachable node is processed exactly once, often involves a *global* `visited_nodes` set. This global set tracks all nodes ever visited across *all* search branches from the start. In our `dfs_with_logging` function, we introduced a `visited_nodes` set, but its primary purpose there was to track all nodes seen *at any point* for potential later analysis (though the actual cycle prevention logic still relied on `if neighbor not in path:`). For simply finding *a* path, checking `neighbor not in path` is sufficient, as we only care about cycles in the immediate path. However, for exploring the *entire* graph or finding *all* paths, a global `visited_nodes` set is crucial to avoid redundant computations across different branches and ensure each node is processed only once."

        "    A search algorithm is considered **complete** if it is guaranteed to find a solution (a path to the goal state) if one exists. For an algorithm to be complete, it must explore all possible paths or nodes relevant to finding the goal without getting stuck in infinite loops or discarding potential solutions.\n",

        "2.  **Role of the `path` variable (branch-specific visited set):**\n",
        "    In our DFS implementations (`dfs` and `dfs_with_logging`), the `path` variable serves as a branch-specific 'visited set'. When exploring a neighbor, we check `if neighbor not in path`. This is crucial for preventing infinite loops in graphs that contain cycles. By adding the `current_node` to `path` at the beginning of each recursive call and only exploring neighbors *not already in the current `path`*, we ensure that DFS does not revisit nodes within the *same branch of exploration*. If a cycle is encountered, DFS will backtrack from the node that would form the cycle, rather than getting stuck in it. This mechanism ensures that each node in a given branch is visited only once, making the algorithm finite for any given branch.\n",

        "    The library graph is explicitly defined as a finite set of nodes and connections (an adjacency list). There are no infinite-depth paths, as all nodes eventually lead back or terminate. Because the graph is finite and our DFS implementation actively prevents revisiting nodes within the current path (effectively pruning cyclic paths within a branch), the algorithm will eventually explore all reachable nodes and branches. Since the goal node 'S' is reachable from the `start_node` 'H', the DFS will not run indefinitely.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Therefore, the DFS algorithm, as implemented, **is complete for this specific problem**. It is guaranteed to find the 'Scroll' if a path exists because it systematically explores all possible paths in a depth-first manner without getting trapped in cycles and within a finite search space. Since we know a path exists, DFS will eventually discover one."

        "*   **DFS Completeness:** For this specific problem, DFS is considered complete. This is due to the finite nature of the library graph, the reachability of the goal node 'S' from 'H', and the implementation's handling of cycles using the `path` variable, which prevents infinite loops and ensures all reachable paths are explored.\n",
