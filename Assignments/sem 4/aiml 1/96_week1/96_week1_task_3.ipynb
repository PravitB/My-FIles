        "\n",
        "#### Assumptions:\n",
        "*   **Reliance on NumPy's Random Number Generator (RNG)**: The primary assumption is that `numpy`'s pseudo-random number generator, when seeded, will produce identical sequences of random numbers across different runs and environments (given the same `numpy` version and underlying system architecture influencing floating-point arithmetic). This ensures that operations depending on `np.random.seed()` are consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Implementation Choices:\n",
        "*   **Function-based Experiment Encapsulation**: The experiment logic is encapsulated within a dedicated Python function, `run_experiment(seed)`. This design choice allows for easy re-execution of the experiment with specific `seed` values, making the experimental process modular and verifiable.\n",
        "*   **Explicit Seed Parameter**: The `run_experiment` function explicitly accepts a `seed` parameter. Inside this function, `np.random.seed(seed)` is called, ensuring that each execution of the experiment with the same seed will yield the exact same 'random' output.\n",
        "*   **Global Random Seed Setting**: At the beginning of the script, `np.random.seed()` is called with a specific `seed_value`. This global setting influences all subsequent `numpy` random operations that are not explicitly seeded, thus guaranteeing overall consistency for any non-experiment-specific random processes.\n",
        "*   **Saving Experiment Outputs**: The results of the experiment are saved to a file (`output.txt`) using `np.savetxt()`. This practice allows for persistence of results, enabling independent verification and comparison across different runs or environments, thereby addressing reproducibility concerns by making the output verifiable.\n",
        "\n",
        "These practices collectively ensure that the results obtained from this notebook can be reliably reproduced by others, fostering transparency and trust in the experimental findings."

        "*   **Random Seeds**: Explicitly setting random seeds using `np.random.seed()` ensures that any operation relying on pseudo-random number generation produces the exact same sequence of \"random\" numbers across different runs, given the same seed. This was done both within the experiment function and globally.\n",
        "*   **Function-based Structure**: Encapsulating the experiment logic within a dedicated Python function (`run_experiment`) with an explicit `seed` parameter promotes modularity and makes it easy to re-execute the experiment with specific seed values, thus making the experimental process verifiable and consistent.\n",
        "*   **Output Saving**: Saving the experiment results to a file (e.g., `output.txt` using `np.savetxt()`) allows for the persistence of results. This enables independent verification and comparison across different runs or environments, directly addressing reproducibility concerns by making the output verifiable and auditable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A `run_experiment` function was successfully defined, which accepts a `seed` parameter and uses `np.random.seed()` internally to generate a consistent array of 5 random floats.\n",
        "*   Running `run_experiment` twice with the same seed (42) yielded identical results: `[0.37454012 0.95071431 0.73199394 0.59865848 0.15601864]`, demonstrating reproducibility.\n",
        "*   Running `run_experiment` with a different seed (100) produced different results: `[0.54340494 0.27836939 0.42451759 0.84477613 0.00471886]`, confirming the seed's effect.\n",
        "*   A global random seed was successfully set to 42 using `np.random.seed(seed_value)` to ensure overall consistency for subsequent NumPy random operations.\n",
        "*   The results of the reproducible experiment were successfully saved to an `output.txt` file using `np.savetxt()`.\n",
        "*   Detailed documentation was created, outlining the assumptions (reliance on NumPy's RNG) and implementation choices (function-based encapsulation, explicit seed parameter, global random seed setting, and saving experiment outputs) to ensure reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The combination of explicit seeding within functions, global seed setting, and persistent output saving provides a robust framework for ensuring the exact reproducibility of computational experiments.\n",
        "*   Further enhancements could include integrating a version control system for both the code and potentially the output files to track changes and facilitate collaborative reproducibility efforts.\n"
